# ðŸš€ Projects

Below is a list of some of my key projects:

---

### Project 1: [Parallel Virus Scanning with CUDA](https://github.com/example-repo)
![Project 1 Image](/files/cuda.jpg)

- Developed a CUDA-based parallel program to detect viral DNA in human samples,  
  achieving significant performance gains on NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs.
- Optimized DNA sequence matching with asynchronous kernel launches and memory transfers,  
  ensuring scalability and efficiency under strict resource constraints.

---

### Project 2: [High-Performance RISC-V Processor Design](https://github.com/another-repo)
- Designed a pipelined RISC-V CPU in Verilog and integrated the Karatsuba Algorithm to optimize matrix multiplication, achieving significant performance improvements.
- Implemented dynamic branch prediction with a Branch History Table and developed hazard detection and forwarding mechanisms to ensure seamless pipeline execution.

### Project 3: [AI-Powered Crowd Density Management for NUS Campus](https://github.com/third-repo)
- Developed and trained ML models for campus crowd density classification, using various techniques to enhance accuracy and efficiency.
- Collected and preprocessed actual crowd images from the NUS campus for training and evaluation.
